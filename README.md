gradle-glu-plugin
=================

A gradle plugin for programmatically controlling glu deployment servers.  This plugin allows you to store your glu json model in source control and apply it to the fabric via gradle.  The model can be stored as a json file or generated using Maps or JsonBuilder closures.  It also provides a simple templating function where an "application" is defined that can generate entries for multiple agents with agent-specific overrides.

See https://github.com/ghale/gradle-glu-plugin/wiki for details on usage.
